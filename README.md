Male employees and those with lower educational levels demonstrate higher turnover, highlighting the need for targeted retention strategies and areas for diversity and inclusion efforts.

6. Survey Scores Correlation
A positive correlation exists between low survey scores and high attrition, underlining the value of employee feedback mechanisms and the importance of employee satisfaction in retention.
